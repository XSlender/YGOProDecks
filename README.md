# YGOProDecks
A repository containing all my Yu-Gi-Oh! PRO decks.

**Warning** I do not run/own meta decks for several reason; the number one beeing that playing with meta decks against non-meta decks could be boring on both side of the battlefield.
I mostly play with friends and online with Yu-Gi-Oh! Pro Percy, and decks I play hold their own against meta ones, so I do not see much interest in investing much in "meta" games.

## Pseudo-competitive decks
Pseudo competitive decks are decks that are not "meta" decks, but can hold their own in a standard local tournament. They can apply to Tier 2 decks.

### Galaxy-eyes white dragon *(Galaxy Blue-Eyes White Dragon)*
This deck is mainly a blue-eyes deck, topped by galaxy-eyes and photon XYZ. The composition of this one made some impressive against meta decks, but could be stopped as it relies heavily on "blue-eyes" cards, and thus could be locked with banishment or magic prohibition.

Pros :
*   Fuckin **BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON** *Kaiba rules !*
*   The LIGHT lv1 tuner combo is interesting to quickly summon synchro out of the extra deck.
*   Magic cards can solve some pressure problems.
*   You have some way to disrupt spell/trap cards with twisters or Spirit of white.
*   You can quickly dispatch 2/3 lv8 3000atk 2500def dragons on the field with the right combo.
*   You can even push further with XYZ and full armor 4000atk and removal, or protects yourself with Number 38 or Number 107.

Cons:
*   Lacks links support; could be frustrating if you rely on XYZ.
*   Can find itself locked T1 if you have the wrong full green hand. (but usually unlock T2, or you're screwed)
*   Relies on spell cards that triggers search engine that can be "Ashed" easily.
*   The power of dragons could be turned against you, with a mighty borrelsword dragon, or a simple Skydive Scorcher.
*   You will sometimes find yourself pushed to defensive stance, even with a badass lv8 dragon, because they are your main assets and you don't want them to be snared or removed from play. The best example is when you have only an Alternative on the field, but you need to protect it to keep the pressure on the opponent. It could be nerve intensive.

**Price :** 5/10 *between 300 and 400ish euros, depending on the cards rarity.*
**Easy to play :** 8/10 *a beginner may train a little but a casual player could learn the deck in hours.*
**Holds against meta :** 5/10 *It will rely on how many ash you take, and how strong your initial draw is.*

### Galaxy-eyes photon *(GALAXY-EYES FUCKER)*
*(as it is a new deck for me, you will have less details than the blue eyes on this)*

This deck combines galaxy-eyes with photon, and use this synergy to mainly rely on heavy XYZ that offers some control effect on the board while having beating-down attacks.

Pros :
*   Relies on combo patterns that are simple to learn.
*   Now this archetype have a link2 to help with XYZ and combo.
*   You can output like 10.000 atk on T2 with the right combo; meta decks don't like that.
*   You have a XYZ for every match-up and situation.
*   You can play the fearsome Cyber-Dragon Infinite.
*   This deck is sometimes played in WCQ or regionals as a surprise deck.

Cons :
*   As the deck relies on putting heavy pressure on the opponent, you can be countered by a heavy control deck.
*   You must learn in which situation put which XYZ in play, as they have certain effect useful, but others that can turns against you.
*   You have to learn all the galaxy-photon combos to push the deck further.
*   You will have to sacrifice some combo card to inject some meta cards like Ash in x3.

**Price :** 7/10 *between 200 and 400ish euros, depending on the cards rarity.*
**Easy to play :** 6/10 *you may have to learn the basic galaxy/photon combo in order th run the deck.*
**Holds against meta :** 7/10 *It will rely on how many ash you take, and how strong your initial draw is.*

## Anti-meta/troll/test decks
Anti-meta decks are mainly designed to counter the "meta". Those decks are based on mechanics that will render meta decks unplayable or will render the decks combo difficult to play. Troll decks are based on mechanics that will make your opponent lose their mind, and can be tricky to play but very fun. Those decks are not easy to play, nor easy to push against a well built deck.

**Anti meta :** This deck is based around the principle of avoiding your opponent to play their deck, as it will block effect, deny spell/trap cards, and render the opponent deck unplayable. This deck is quite simple to play, but it efficiency may vary.

**Exodia OTK :** This deck is based on the Royal Magical Library draw engine, that will requires you to draw and play as many spell cards as possible, and get the 5 parts of exodia in your hand or in play. You should play first or second, but you might want to close your combo in one turn, as a further play may just make you lose.

**Inferno tempest - eiza :** A well built deck that will hold against most of decks, as long as you have a good draw. This deck centers around the Eiza card that will take 100x the number of your banished card, and the combo inferno tempest > D.D. Dynamite. It's a simple deck to play and a real fun one.

**Blue-eyes tournament 2018 alternative :** This is a basic blue-eyes chaos MAX dragon deck. Not really viable, not really optimized and balanced. I encourage you to play the Galaxy-Eyes White Dragon listed above.

**Exodia test :** This deck is a basic exodia deck, maintaining control abilities while allowing you to draw and search for exodia parts.

**Mill deck :** This deck is a try at copying MTG "mill" principle in YGO. It's a test, and thus, not a viable deck.

**Test true draco :** This is an attempt of myself to get on the meta format with a relative easy deck to learn. You may not rely on it to do your meta deck.
